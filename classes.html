          Although I largely focus on the principles of responsive design in this course, I also make time to explicitly name and discuss
          the factors that shape and impact one's CS identity. This is especially important to me in this class because it
          often contains students who are new to computer science. This means that the opportunity to shape identity for the better is
          much higher because there are fewer walls to deconstruct at this point in their educational career.
          I tend to use fishbowl discussions to facilitate the development of a positive CS identity, and have included a sample

            I ask my students to reflect on the state of their computing identity every week throughout the year.
            As expected, we start to see a decline in positive computing identities around Unit 5.
            I'm hoping that more fishbowl discussions outside of Unit 1 can help combat this trend.

        <p class="resize-mobile-descriptions">
          I began my teaching career with this class, and boy,
          has it changed over the years. The AP exam for this class lends
          itself to trying out different programming languages
          because the College Board has given instructors the
          flexibility to choose the language they think is best for
          their students' success. Given this, I have tried all kinds
          of languages to see which one works best in the world of
          novice programming. This list includes: Scratch, Python, Racket,
          Lua, C++, and JavaScript. I expected Python to be the best choice for new
          learners because it strikes a nice balance between authentic,
          powerful and readable. However, my time teaching Python redefined the terms
          "powerful" and "readable" for me as an educator; <i>powerful</i>
          quickly became <i>the space is too large to navigate</i> and <i>readable</i>
          became <i>too many details are hidden from the learner.</i>
          I actually think that C++ is closer to what new programmers need
          to successfully understand the machine below but I'm also concerned
          about switching langauges too often. I believe that learning to
          program is like learning a new language -- it takes years of studying
          the same language to really understand the underlying mechanics of the
          broader set of related langauges, and because of this,
          I'm sticking with JavaScript. Also, there are some really nifty
          drawing libraries in JS! These libraries help narrow the scope of the
          langauge as a whole and more clearly illustrate how programming can be
          a creative process (yes, yes Python has these too but whitespace is way
          harder for children to understand than curly braces and semi-colons).
          In case you're curious, here's the current course outline for my AP CSP class:

          For me, teaching AP CSA well is the greatest thing I can do to help level the playing field for underrepresented
          groups in CS. Why? The material covered in this class is the content typically discussed within
          the first year of a CS degree program. This level of exposure prior to metriculation has
          shown to help students persist within CS degrees simply because that's what it takes to be ready to compete. For example, while
          at Berkeley completing my own degree, I met many people who had been programming since they were small
          children. These students were (falsely) labeled as "naturals" simply because they had the prior experience
          they needed to appear as if it were organic talent. Not in my opinion; they just had the competitive
          edge of starting early! Now imagine how this impacts one's CS identity (it's not pretty).
          <div class="identity-impact buffer">
          <!--  <ol>
              <li><h5>Recognition:</h5>
                <p>
                  I think this component of one's CS identity is the most fragile in college, where imposter syndrome is
                  as common as bad cafeteria food. In my opinion, it's tightly coupled with something I call "perceived relative performance", which describes
                  how students tend to view their own abilities in relation to the perceived abilities of their peers'. Obviously, this is an unfair
                  comparison to make if you're comparing yourself to someone who has been programming since they were a small child, but it happens, and it's extremely
                  detrimental to one's ability to persist within a competitive program like Berkeley's.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><h5>Performance:</h5>
                <p>
                  Comparitively, you might know less simply because you haven't seen as much. This means your performance relative to the
                  curve is possibly lower if you don't work twice as hard to learn the material like the kid who was programming since birth. This feeds
                  into the concept of "perceived relative performance", which only exacerbates the problems seen within the "Recognition" component
                  of one's CS identity.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><h5>Interest:</h5>
                <p>
                  At the end of the day, if you don't feel successul in a subject, you won't have an interest to study it more. This is further
                  negatively impacted by the fact that those who were exposed early, probably had social structures in place to confirm that computer science
                  was an interesting and worthwhile subject to explore. Those who didn't have similar opportunities, are much more likely to carry misconceptions
                  about who is a computer scientist and who is not.
                </p>
